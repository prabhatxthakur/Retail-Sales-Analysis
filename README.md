In this project, we deep dive into the retail sales data to provide insights that answer crucial questions for stakeholders. Leveraging the power of Python and its libraries, along with MySQL for data storage and analysis, we were able to derive valuable insights that support decision-making.

Questions:

Q1: What are the top 10 highest revenue-generating products by category?
Q2: Which are the top 5 highest-selling products in each region?
Q3: How does the month-over-month growth compare for sales in 2022 and 2023?
Q4: For each category, which month & year saw the highest sales?
Q5: Which subcategory exhibited the highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022?

Our approach involved utilizing the Kaggle API to access relevant datasets, employing the zipfile library for data extraction, and leveraging Pandas for data cleaning and analysis. We seamlessly connected the cleaned data to MySQL database using SQL Alchemy library, enabling efficient querying and analysis.
